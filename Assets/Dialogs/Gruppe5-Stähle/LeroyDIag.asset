  - Nice to meet you!
  - If you want to get some gold, I've got some tasks for you!
  - Since years we are searching for artefacts of an old civilisation. We've only
    found one so far, but it held a hint for more artefacts.
  - It spoke to us and told us that there is an artefact at the beginning of the
    world. We don't know more.
  - Can you help us? If you find and hand us the artefacts, I will let gold rain
    upon you.
  awaitingQuestCompletion: Have you found them all?
  questDone: Thank you for your service
